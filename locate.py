"""locate.py - one command: capture the sky, count satellites, and (if enough
are visible) compute your position - written ONLY to lab_local/ (gitignored).

Run this with the antenna at a window or outdoors, or on a GPS patch antenna.
Indoors you'll see 1-3 weak satellites (not enough); with sky view, 6-12.

  python locate.py            # 180 s capture on Antenna A, then locate
  python locate.py --iq f.cs16   # locate from an existing capture

A 3D fix needs >= 4 satellites strong enough to decode their orbit (metric > 3.5,
C/N0 ~ 38+). This prints the count first so you know immediately whether the sky
view is good; if it is, the full pseudorange solve runs and the result stays
private in lab_local/fix_result.json.
