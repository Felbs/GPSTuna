"""Dig GPS L1 C/A satellites out of thermal noise with a TV antenna.

GPS L1 (1575.42 MHz) arrives at about -130 dBm — roughly 20 dB BELOW
the thermal noise floor of a 2 MHz channel. You cannot see it on any
spectrum display. What rescues it is the grid: every satellite
transmits a known 1023-chip Gold code at exactly 1.023 Mchip/s
(one code epoch per millisecond), BPSK-spread, with 50 bps navigation
data on top. Correlating 1 ms of signal against a local code replica
concentrates the signal 30 dB (10*log10(1023)); noncoherent stacking
of a few hundred epochs buys the rest.

This script derives, from raw wideband IQ (no LNA, no GPS antenna):
  1. C/A code generator self-check vs published IS-GPS-200 octals
  2. parallel code-phase acquisition: all 32 PRNs x Doppler bins
     (FFT circular correlation, 1 ms coherent x N noncoherent)
  3. per-SV track over the capture: code-phase drift must equal
     -carrier_doppler/1540 (the code clock and carrier are locked to
     the same atomic standard 1540 half-cycles apart)
  4. measured C/A epoch length vs the value the carrier predicts
  5. the 50 bps navigation-data bit grid (20 ms alignment energy)
  6. optional: TLE cross-check (which SVs were overhead, predicted
     Doppler per SV, common receiver clock offset)

Usage:
  python measure.py --iq gps_l1_rabbit.cs16 --fs 2048000
        [--iq2 gps_l1_discone.cs16]   # second capture for the acq figure
        [--tle gps_ops.tle]           # celestrak gps-ops TLE file
        [--t0 "2026-07-20T12:14:27Z"] # capture start UTC (for TLE check)
        [--lat <deg> --lon <deg>]     # optional, only for --tle sky-check
        [--selftest]                  # synthetic -20 dB proof, then exit

Privacy note: the default lat/lon is a deliberately coarse central-
Virginia grid point. Elevation and Doppler predictions change by less
than the TLE error over ~100 km, so a vague point is all this needs.
This script never computes a position fix.
